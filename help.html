<h3 id="example">Example game</h3>
<p>The following example demonstrates all of the basic features for games.
The easiest way to figure out what it does is to play it.  Just copy the
content into a new game definition and you're ready to play.</p>

<p>The game layout is shown below.  Players start at L1; they win when
they reach L5.</p>

<pre>
  L5           
  |            ^ N
  |            |
  L3 -- L2     |
  |     |
  |     |
  L4 -- L1
</pre>

<p>The key, which is found in the flowerpot at L1, is required to open
the gate at L3.  Note that using the key at L3 changes the state of that
location to L3.unlocked (<tt>"use" : {"#key" : "^L3.unlocked"}</tt>).
This notion simplifies the game setup, because L2, L4, and L5 need
connect only to the primary location (L3), not all states of L3.</p>

<h3 id="syntax">Syntax details</h3>

<p>The game definition is a <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> object
that adheres to a schema defined by the adventure game.</p>

<p>As an editor, the easiest way to ensure you have a valid JSON object is
to edit your content in the handy 
<a href="http://www.jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a> validator.  After you've
created a valid JSON object, then copy and paste the content into a game
definition and try it out.  If you run into any problems (e.g. locations
not linked as you intended), then repeat the process:  Edit in JSONLint;
copy and paste into the game definition; and try it out.</p>

<p>A few things to note about JSON:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to use double quotes within a string, then they
    must be <i>escaped</i>.  For example:  <tt>"\"Good luck finding
    the pot of gold!\""</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Details about the schema:</p>

<h4>Top-level properties</h4>
<table border="1">
<tr>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Required?</th>
  <th>Value type</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>start</tt></td>
  <td>Required</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Name of the location where players will start the game.
  Must be defined in <tt>location_definition</tt>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>description</tt></td>
  <td>Required</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Short description of the game.  This string is displayed in the
  list of games as well as in the welcome message when a player
  starts a game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>location_definitions</tt></td>
  <td>Required</td>
  <td>object</td>
  <td>name/value pairs, with:
<ul>
<li>name == location name
<li>value == location definition (see below)
</ul></td>

</table>

<h4>Location definition</h4>
<table border="1">
<tr>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Required?</th>
  <th>Value type</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>description</tt></td>
  <td>Required</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Displayed when the player reaches this location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>look</tt></td>
  <td>Optional</td>
  <td>object</td>
  <td>name/value pairs, with:
<ul>
<li>name == object to look at
<li>value == response to <tt>look &lt;object&gt;</tt>
</ul>

There are two types of responses:
<ul>
<li>Indication of a portable item; value starts with a
    "#" character, such as <tt>#key</tt>.  Users can take this item with
    <tt>take key</tt>.  The game player generates the appropriate
    response to a look command:
  <ul>
  <li>Item has not been taken:  <tt>You see a key.</tt>    
  <li>Item has been taken:  <tt>You already found the key here.</tt>
  </ul>
<li>Text response.  If the value does not start with a "#", then the string
    is the response to a look command.
</ul>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>use</tt></td>
  <td>Optional</td>
  <td>object</td>
  <td>name/value pairs, with:
<ul>
<li>name == item to be used (two representations; see below)
<li>value == response to <tt>use &lt;object&gt;</tt>
</ul>

There are two representations for the item be to used:
<ul>
<li>Portable item; value starts with a "#" character.  This is typically
    used to indicate an item that the player is supposed to <tt>take</tt>
    in another location and bring as part of their inventory, such as
    a key.
<li>Fixed item; value does not start with a "#" character.  Typically
    an item that is part of the location, such as a switch.
</ul>

The response can be a string or an array of strings.  For an array, the
elements are processed in order.  The array form can be used, for example,
with state changes:  The first element might be a text response that
describes the change ("The gate swings open.") and the second commands
the state change ("^L3.unlocked").

There are three types of response strings:
<ul>
<li>New location; value starts with an "@" character.  For example,
    <tt>@L5</tt> will move the player to location L5.
<li>State change at the current location; value starts with a "^" character.
    For example, <tt>^L3.unlocked</tt> means that a use command on that
    item will change the current location to definition L3.unlocked.
<li>Text response.  If the value does not start with an "@" or a "^",
    then the string is the response to the use command.
</ul>
